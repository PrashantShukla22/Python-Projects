Uber Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Uber trip data using Python. The goal is to clean, process, and extract meaningful insights from the dataset to understand ride patterns, demand trends, and operational efficiencies. The insights can help improve marketing strategies and optimize operational planning.

Key Features
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and handled outliers to ensure data reliability.
Data Analysis: Used Python libraries to derive key insights, such as peak ride demand, most popular locations, and temporal trends.
Data Visualization: Created interactive and static plots to communicate insights effectively.
Tools and Libraries
The following Python libraries were used in this project:

pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
numpy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib and seaborn: For creating static visualizations.
plotly: For creating interactive visualizations.
Insights Derived
Peak Ride Demand:

Weekends and evenings saw the highest ride requests, accounting for a 20% increase in urban areas compared to weekdays.
Geographic Trends:

High ride density observed in urban centers during peak hours, with suburban areas contributing to off-peak rides.
Temporal Patterns:

Increased demand during holiday seasons, showing a 15% spike in ride requests.
